            <div class="chatter"><p>The San Francisco Chronicle unveiled the NorCal Beer Hall of Fame in 2019 to recognize our region’s most iconic beers. We induct individual beers, not breweries. It’s a way of commemorating the indelible cultural imprint that craft beer has made on Northern California – and that Northern California has made on the rest of the world.</p>
            <p>Each year, to determine the set of inductees, we ask Chronicle readers to vote for their picks. We then convene a panel of staff beer experts to cast another set of votes. The reader vote is ultimately weighed equally with the staff vote.</p></div>

                <p class="description"><i>Boonville &bull; Inducted 2020</i></p>
                <p class="text">Since 1987, Anderson Valley Brewing has been turning out quirky beers that speak to the peculiar local culture of Boonville, in rural Mendocino County. No beer better exemplifies its style than Boont Amber Ale, with its delicious tension between sweet, malty caramel and piquant, citrusy bitterness. The beer’s name alludes to Boontling, Anderson Valley’s local dialect, spoken by a diminishing number of people but kept alive in spirit by the brewery.</p>

                <p class="description"><i>Cloverdale &bull; Inducted 2020</i></p>
                <p class="text">When the Norgrove family first opened a brew pub in downtown Healdsburg in 1995, they probably couldn’t have imagined that by 2020 they’d rank as the 49th largest craft brewery in the U.S. Much of that success is due to Racer 5, a hoppy, full-bodied American IPA that helped propel the category to superstardom.</p>

                <p class="text">Can a beer that’s less than 10 years old earn a place in the Northern California Beer Hall of Fame? Apparently, yes: Fort Point Beer Co.’s meteoric rise has made its signature Kolsch-style ale a classic in its own time. It’s also one of the only Hall of Fame candidates that most of us encounter in the form of a can, as opposed to a bottle. The sleek black can with gold geometric lines has become a ubiquitous presence throughout Northern California.</p>

                <p class="description"><i>San Francisco &bull; Inducted 2019</i></p>
                <p class="text">Arguably, no beer has had a greater influence on craft brewing in America than Anchor Steam. The pioneering brewery began making steam beer in the 19th century, an advantageous recipe for the time, since it did not require temperature control technology. When Fritz Maytag revived the flailing Anchor Brewing Co., beginning in 1965, he kept steam beer at the heart of the brewery’s identity — and, in the process, kicked off a revolution.</p>

                <p class="text">Lagunitas founder Tony Magee wasn’t exactly the first to make a West Coast IPA — a style loosely defined by more hops, more bitterness and more booze — but his Lagunitas IPA became the category’s calling card, paving the way for an entire generation of bigger beers.</p>

                <p class="text">Trumer has two breweries: one in Obertrum, Austria, open since 1601, and the other in Berkeley, open since 2004. Without a doubt, the green bottles (and, now, white and silver cans) are ubiquitous around Bay Area bars, and have been for years — predating the wave of craft pilsners we’re currently experiencing. While one could argue Trumer isn't a NorCal beer, it was voted into our Hall of Fame by readers in 2019, and readers will always have a say.</p>
